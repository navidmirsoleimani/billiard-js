# 🎱 Billiard Simulator (HTML, CSS & JS - Canvas)

A simple **billiards simulation game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas API)**.
This project simulates the **first shot in billiards**, allowing the player to control the stick direction with the mouse and shoot the cue ball with variable power.
